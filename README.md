# Speed Runner
This repository was used for Mini Challenge 1 from the Apple Developer Academy Cohort 2022. My team and I conducted domain research for this project in order to develop an app statement, which was as follows:

*For **College students**
that help them to **organize their tasks by listing their existing tasks**, 
then **labeling it with several parameter to determine the priority** and using 
**the Pomodoro technique** to work on the selected task from the list that has been made before.*

Speed Runner is Lo-fi App by CBC.
